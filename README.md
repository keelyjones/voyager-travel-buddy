# Voyager Travel Buddy

![Voyager Travel Buddy](assets/images/travelPlanning.jpg)

This project is a single-page frontend web application which relies heavily on the Google Maps API and the Google Places API, to allows users to plan their next adventure, providing inspiration for things to do during their visit.

Users can:
* Select a destination city
* Find tourist attractions
* Find accommodation
* Find bars and restaurants

 
## UX
 
Provide search results in a manner that is visually appealing for your user (by drawing on the skills you have learned in User-Centric Frontend Development)

* Incorporate links or buttons to allow your user to navigate the site and reset/control the site functionality
* Whenever possible, strive to use semantic HTML5 elements to structure your HTML code better.
* Make sure your site is as responsive as possible. You can test this by checking the site on different screen sizes and browsers. Please note that if you are building a data dashboard, only your chart containers are expected to be responsive. Charts using D3.js are not responsive as they are designed for desktop or large-screen viewing.
* The site can also make use of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, just make sure you maintain a clear separation between the library code and your code.


### User Stories

- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

### Wireframe

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
My initial design process can be seen here: https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/view/milestone-project-3-mockup
I have tried to keep the design as simple as possible, with simple colour schemes, and the main focus of the app is the map itself.
I have created mockups for both desktop and mobile versions of the application.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
- [Jasmine]()
    - This project makes use of **Jasmine**, a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code, to ensure that all of my JavaScript is working.
- [CSS]() & [Bootstrap]()
- [HTML]()
    - This application has been built using **HTML5**
- [GoogleMaps API]()
    - The primary functionality of this project has been enabled by utising **GoogleMaps API**
- [GooglePlaces API]()
    - This project also uses **GooglePlaces API** to provide suggestions for restaurants, bars, museums, etc.


## Testing

Use Git & GitHub for version control. Each new piece of functionality should be in a separate commit.

You should conduct and document tests to ensure that all of your websiteâ€™s functionality works well.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
